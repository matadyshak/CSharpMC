Rolling the ball is like clocking a state machine
After each roll the tally can always be appended to and the HCOUNT incremented appropriately
The score cannot be filled in in case of a spare or a strike
In case of open frame the score is up to date with the tally
Identify the inputs and outputs
Frames 1-8 are identical
Frame 9 can effect Frame 10 but not Frame 11
Frame 10 can have 2 or 3 rolls
Could print all the frame numbers first
Keep changing between the tally row and the score row
Need TallyHCount and ScoreHCount
Want a method that outputs the incremental tally
Want a method that outputs the incremental score
Want a method that is called by main which performs the 3-game series and has option to run again
All variables will be static
All methods will be static
